Repo for the dataset, and code for the associated paper "ReSORT: ReSORT: an ID-recovery multi-face tracking method for surveillance cameras". This reporsitory contains the annotations for dataset and the code (coming soon...) from the associated paper, for the task of multi-face tracking.

## Dataset: 
We will release three face-tracking annotations files for three respective public dataset, include MSU-AVIS, LAB-dataset and Chokepoint.  
## Code:
The code to produce multi-face tracking results: Coming soon...

## Demo:
Our proposed tracker - ReSORT, compared to SORT and DeepSORT, decreases the number of switching IDs effectively.
